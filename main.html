	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time it takes to run, improving performance and scalability, especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that memory usage increases linearly with the size of the input, making it scalable for larger datasets.</p>
