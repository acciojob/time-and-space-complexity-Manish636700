	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity measures the execution time of an algorithm based on input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, enabling faster execution and better performance, especially for large datasets.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> ndicates the memory an algorithm uses. O(n) means memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
